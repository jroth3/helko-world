   <dt class="category">About me. Have a corndog!</dt>
   <dd>My name is Joe Roth. I'm currently a student at K-State Salina, and I'm majoring in Digital Media Technology, with a focus on web design. I've grown up in Overland Park KS, so I like to go where the weather is fun and mostly cool. My work goal is a career where I make a good earning and enjoy work at the same time. My personal goal is to be financially stable enough to travel to Europe and South America without worry!

   <dt class="category">My portfolio!</dt>
   <dd>Here is the place where I'll put my other projects for other classes, plus a few additional files that I made in my freetime, mostly for practice. Everything here is made by me for different classes throughout the years, and I'm proud of all of them, even the small things. Please tave a look!

  <dt class="category">McDonalds App design</dt>
  <img src="McDonalds app demo PDF version copy.png" alt="An app for mcdonalds, text says say hello to new deals." style="width: 30%"/>
  <dd>The McDonalds project was our first redesign. We had to make something for a mcdonalds app, and I've decided on a deals page. It taught me basic design as well as gradients! Although basic, it's a good start on what was to come.

  <dt class="category">Movie Poster</dt>
  <img src="Emperor's New Groove Poster.png" alt="Emperor's new groove movie poster" style="width: 40%"/>
  <dd>One of my favorites! For this, we had to create a movie poster for a movie of our choice, so long as it's either hollywood-made or very popular. I chose a favorite of mine, The Emperor's New Groove. For this, I've decided to take the characters and make them into a giant llama. This is to show how they're all involved in this shenanigan whether they like it or not. All while being stylistic to the movie.
  (As a bonus, you can spot Kronk's angel and devil. You can guess where they are!)

  <dt class="category">Image as Text</dt>
  <img src="Chorizo!.png" alt="The word chorizo on a chorizo sausage" style="width: 60%"/>
  <dd>This was a fun one. We had to take an image and make it out of text, or use images to create words. I went with the former. At the time I was craving a chorizo breakfast burrito and I let my hands do the work. 
  The word "chorizo" is actually invisible; there's a picture of the sausage behind it. Then I added back on the twists on the ends and there you have it! A raw but delicious chorizo.

  <dt class="category">Improving The Flag of Milwaukee</dt>
  <img src="milwaukee flag - better copy.png" alt="The Milwaukee flag, but less busy" style="width: 55%"/>
  <dd>One of my own projects! A friend in my group chat said the Milwaukee flag hurts to look at. Apparently they thought it was too busy. I did a simple fix by removing most of the lights, giving your eyes a chance to rest a bit. It's obviously not a perfect rendition, but the point is that sometimes a little fix can go a long way.

  <dt class="category">Bad image</dt>
  <img src="DICKS.png" alt="The logo for Dicks Sporting Goods but it looks like a dick" style="width: 60%"/>
  <dd>A fun twist! We had to make a logo that is bad on purpose. Other people in the class chose to make some good ones that looked cheap or sketchy, but I went for something else. There are several logos out there like "Safespace" and "Kid's Exchange" with unintentionally bad design. I took a popular name and did something similar. My professor is (jokingly) ashamed of me, so it's a success!

  <dt class="category">5 Picture Story</dt>
  <img src="5 picture story.png" alt="Five pictures showing a construction site, a casino, a building demolition, the leftover ruins, and some street breakdancers. " style="width: 60%"/>
  <dd>This is for a web project during summer school. We had to make a story with five pictures and no words. What do you see?

  <img src="Mountain of the bird copy.png" alt="A crow on a mountain with a volcano and a red moon. The crow is wearing 3 hats. In the corner is a stray Varrick" style="width: 40%"/>
  <dd>A silly picture I made at the beginning of the school year, with some help from a friend for the red layering. This is simply made to show others I have a sense of humor, and that we're allowed to be silly! As a side note, this was inspired by Breath of the Wild.

  <dt class="category">Pong!</dt> 
  <img src="homemade_pong.png" alt="Homemade Pong! Too much work went into this being functional." style="width: 60%"/>
  <dd>This was for a Programming final for May 2022. We had to take concepts from the class throughout the semester (such as loops, keybinds, logic commands, and so on) and make something out of them. The only buttons you need are W+S for left paddle and up+down for right paddle. Even though it's a bit shabby, I'm still proud of it.
